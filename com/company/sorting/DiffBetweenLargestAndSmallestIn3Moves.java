/**
 *
 * 1509. Minimum Difference Between Largest and Smallest Value in Three Moves
 * Medium
 *
 * You are given an integer array nums. In one move, you can choose one element of nums and change it by any value.
 *
 * Return the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of nums after performing at most three moves.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [5,3,2,4]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: Change the array [5,3,2,4] to [2,2,2,2].
 * The difference between the maximum and minimum is 2-2 = 0.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,5,0,10,14]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: Change the array [1,5,0,10,14] to [1,1,0,1,1].
 * The difference between the maximum and minimum is 1-0 = 1.
